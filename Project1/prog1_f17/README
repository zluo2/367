This tar file contains the following files:
   * fp.h  - header file with the 'representation' (# exponent & fraction bits)
   * fp_functs.c - function stubs that you will code
   * fp_reference - a reference executable - your answer should be identical
   * Makefile
   * Files to build the driver: fp.l fp_program.c fpParse.h test_pgm.o
   * output_all_values.c - Simple program to output all of the floats that
          are representatable with the given number of bits.  This program
          will be useful when you are trying to determine if your program
          is working correctly.
   * Some sample programs - you can write others or enter programs on
        the command line

Once you type 'make', you will also have:
   * fp - executable for your program
   * all_values - executable assocaited with output_all_values
   * various .o files that you can ignore


The only two files you should be modifying are fp.h (if needed) and fp_functs.c
